# #100DaysOfCode

This is a log of #100DaysOfCode Challenge. The challenge is to code at least 1 hour a day. Here's my log for daily coding for the next 100 days.

A note about WakaTime logs: [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) is a webapp that logs the amount of time I spend typing in VS Code. It does not include the time I spend reading and researching about various webdev concepts.
